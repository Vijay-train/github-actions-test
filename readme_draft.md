# Actions Runner Controller (ARC)


Github Actions automates the deployment of code to different environments, including production. The environments contain the `Github Runner` software which executes the automation. The `Github Runner` can be run in GitHub-hosted cloud or self hosted environments. Self-hosted runners offer more control of hardware, operating system, and software tools than GitHub-hosted runners provide. They can be run on physical machines, virtual machines, or  in a container. 

Containerized environments are lightweight, loosely coupled, highly efficient and can be managed centrally. However, they are not straightforward to use. 

`Actions Runner Controller(ARC)` makes it simpler to run self hosted runners on Kubernetes(K8s) containers. `ARC` is a K8s controller to create self-hosted runners on your K8s cluster.

With `ARC` you can : 
- **Deploy your self hosted runners on Kubernetes cluster** with a simple set of commands.
- **Auto scale runners** based on demand.
- **Setup across Github editions** including Github Enterprise editions and Github Enterprise Cloud.
 

> Though `actions-runner-controller` is used in production environments, it is still in its early stage of development, hence versioned 0.x. `actions-runner-controller` complies to Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 in which v0.x means that there could be backward-incompatible changes for every release.

The documentation is kept inline with master@HEAD, we do our best to highlight any features that require a specific ARC version or higher however this is not always easily done due to there being many moving parts. Additionally, we actively do not retain compatibly with every GitHub Enterprise Server version nor every Kubernetes version so you will need to ensure you stay current within a reasonable timespan.


 
# Lets try it

Get up and running with ARC with only a few steps. For more details, refer to [Quick start guide](https://github.com/actions-runner-controller/actions-runner-controller/blob/master/QuickStartGuide.md). ðŸš€
